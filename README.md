🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application
A fully interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

This project allows users to play the classic game either against another player or against a simple AI opponent. 

The goal, as always, is to get three of your markers in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
📌 Project Overview
This project was created to practice and demonstrate core web development skills, including:
1.	Handling user interactions with JavaScript
2.	Dynamically updating the UI based on game state
3.	Implementing game logic such as turn-taking and win/draw detection
4.	Creating a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface with HTML & CSS
5.	It serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to build simple browser games or learn more about DOM manipulation.
✨ Features

✅ Real-time win detection: The game announces the winner immediately once a winning pattern is detected.

✅ Responsive design: Works on desktop and mobile browsers.
✅ Reset/New Game options: Quickly restart the game or start a new match.
