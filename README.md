### 🕹️ Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application:
A fully interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to play the classic game either against another player or against a simple AI opponent. The goal, as always, is to get three of your markers in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
### 📌 Project Overview: 

1. This project was created to practice and demonstrate core web development skills, including:

2.	Handling user interactions with JavaScript
   
3.	Dynamically updating the UI based on game state
	
4.	Implementing game logic such as turn-taking and win/draw detection
	
5.	Creating a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface with HTML & CSS
	
6.	It serves as a great starting point for anyone looking to build simple browser games or learn more about DOM manipulation.

### ✨ Features:
✅ Player vs Player mode: Two users can take turns playing on the same device.

✅ Player vs AI mode: Challenge a basic AI that makes random or predefined moves.

✅ Real-time win detection: The game announces the winner immediately once a winning pattern is detected.

✅ Draw detection: The game recognizes and announces when there’s no winner.

✅ Responsive design: Works on desktop and mobile browsers.

✅ Reset/New Game options: Quickly restart the game or start a new match.

### 🚀 Technologies Used:
